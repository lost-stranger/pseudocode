Questions

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A> Searching for a specific bottle of wine at a wine store. I go through each rack, going through each bottle label, until I find the one that I am looking for until I get it.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A> when working on a large excel sheet to find a find a certain row, I would use the the mouse to click on slider to move the page to middle of the sheet. If the row I am looking for is
beyond the middle row, I would then click on the mouse to move the cursor to the middle of the bottom half of the page. I would do this until I find the row of data that I am looking for.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A> It would take 7 iterations to find the value G.

4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A> It would take 2 iterations to find the value G.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A> Since the items are unsorted, we would have to check each item to find the item that we are searching for; hence, I would use linear search.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A> Since the items are sorted, I would use binary search as each iteration would would cut the array in half.  With a time complexity of O(log n), 
binary search is more likely to find the answer than binary search O(n).

Programming

1.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function binary_search(arr, letter){
    var low = 0;
    var middle = Math.floor(arr.length/2);
    var high = arr.length -1;

    while(high > low){
        if(letter < arr[middle]){
            high = middle -1;
            middle = Math.floor((low + high)/2);
        }else if (letter > arr[middle]){
            low = middle +1;
            middle = Math.floor((low + high)/2);
        }else {
            return middle;
        }
    }
}

var arr =['Aa','Ab','Albatross','Arm','d','e','f','gary','k'];

var letter = 'Albatross';
console.log(binary_search(arr, letter));

2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var petList  = [{container:'fish-tank', type:'goldfish', desc: 'spotted', colour:'black'},
                {container:'fish-tank', type:'goldfish', desc: 'spotted', colour:'white'},
                {container:'kennel', type:'doberman', desc: 'mix', colour:'black'},
                {container:'kennel', type:'labrador', desc: 'spotted', colour:'golden'},
                {container:'cat-cage', type:'tabby', desc: 'striped', colour:'brown'}];

var searched  = [{container:'fish-tank', type:'goldfish', desc: 'spotted', colour:'white'}];

function searchPet(petList, searched){
  
  for (let i = 0; i<petList.length; i++){
    if(petList[i].container == searched[0].container &&
       petList[i].type == searched[0].type &&
       petList[i].desc == searched[0].desc &&
       petList[i].colour == searched[0].colour){
       return  i;
    }
  }
 }

 console.log(searchPet(petList, searched));
