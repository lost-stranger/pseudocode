Q1 Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode is used by programmers to describe what a code should do. 
This helps them and other programmers understand the purpose of the alogrithm that is to be written.


Q2 If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
The pseudocode is unreadable by comeputer and meant only for human comprhension. I expect a number of syntax errors to be called out by the computer

Pseudocode practice:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT two numbers
ADD the two numbers and store the result
RETURN the result

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT (starting with) sum as zero and 
{INIT the first number as one
FOR (as long as) the number does not increase beyond 100
 ADD the number to the sum
 INCREMENT the number by one}
 RETURN the sum number

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT an array of objects(entries) with properties which include Name as a property
INPUT the Name that one is looking for
CREATE a new list to store potential search results
{ INIT starting with the first array object,
  FOR as long as the objects searched is limited to the maximum provided in the phoneboook (array) run through each object and check,
    {IF the entry's name (object name property) is the same as the name provided in INPUT
    If there is a match, store the entre object in the array of search results
  IF END}
}
RETURN the array of search results
	
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phoneList = [
  {name: 'Arun', tel: '123'},
  {name: 'abc', tel: '456'},
  {name: 'def', tel: '789'} 
];

var entry = 'Arun';

function searchName(phoneList, entry){
  
  var searchList = new Array();

  for (i=0; i<phoneList.length; i++){
    if(phoneList[i].name === entry )
      searchList.push(phoneList[i]);
  }
  return searchList;
}

console.log(searchName(phoneList, entry));
