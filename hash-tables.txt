Questions:

1. What is a hash table?

A> Hash table is a type of data structure that maps each value to a unique key and then stores the key-value pair. 
The key which is a string is then converted to a number using the hashing function creating a hash code. 
The hash code is then used to store the key-value pair in the has table's internal array.

2. What is hashing?

A> Hashing is the process of converting a string to number through a mathematical process. String keys are converted to numbers creating hash codes by hashing function.

3. How does a hash table store data?

A> Hash tables store data by taking the value to be stored, mapped to an identifier/key, and then storing the key-value pair. It does so through the following steps:
1) It takes the key and converts to a Hash Code using a Hashing Function.
2) To get the true index of the value in the arrray, mod the Hash Code by the capacity of the hasing function.
4) Store the Value in the Array Index.

3. How are hash tables and objects different?

A> Certain programs allow both objects and hash tables and they can be used interchangeably - the prperty of an object can be used as a key to store as key-value pair in a Hash Table and vice versa.
It is preferable to use object as data stucture if data consists of a static number of distince values. If the data consists of a variable number consistently formatted values with a unique
identifier, then hash tables is othe preferred data structure.
